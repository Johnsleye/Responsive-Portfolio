                <p>I am very Outgoing and detail-oriented, energetic and fun to be with. I am very proficient at building and
                    oiling professional relationships, I learn very fast. I communicate clearly and concisely. I have associate
                    degree in accounting and currently attending Case Wester Reserve University Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>In our current world where everything is becoming virtual, I envisaged that one of the professions that will
                    take over the universe, if not the only one, is information technology. Thus, I have taken the challenge
                    to equip myself with what it takes to function better in that world by learning web development. News
                    reporting, Sales, Marketing, Health, Schools and whatever you can think of, is moving from the conventional
                    ways of doing them to online. Therefore, I decided to throw my cap into the ring of web development.</p>
